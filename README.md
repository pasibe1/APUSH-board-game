# APUSH-board-game
An early board game project built with Java.


PROJECT TITLE: AP US History 1920’s board game


PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A virtual board game I created during high school a few years after learning how to code. This was my submission for a project in my AP U.S. History class. In lieu of creating a physical board game like 99% of the rest of the class, I decided to flex my programming chops and create this bad boy instead. All the board game questions center around topics in U.S. history during the 1920’s. Coded in Java using the Greenfoot API.


VERSION or DATE: v1.0 February 2014


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Simply open the executable file called “Pascal - APUSH game” to start the game. 


AUTHORS: Pascal G. Ibe


USER INSTRUCTIONS: Enter a number for the amount of players and click "Run" when the application opens. On each player's turn, first click the die to roll it and see how many spaces you can move. Then click the card stack to get a question. The card up top will be the prompt card. The player will have to select one of the four cards on the bottom which matches the prompt. If they select the right card then they can move the number of spaces on the dice and gain a point. If not, then the turn will move on to the next player. After a player accumulates 15 points and they make it back to where they originated on the board (on the board space in front of one of the 4 bridges to the center that corresponds to your token color) they will be able to reach the center and win the game.
