# APUSH-board-game
An old AP US History 1920’s board game


PROJECT TITLE: AP US History 1920’s board game


PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A virtual board game I created during high school a few years after learning how to code. This was my submission for a project in my AP U.S. History class. In lieu of creating a physical board game like 99% of the rest of the class, I decided to flex my programming chops and create this bad boy instead. All the board game questions center around topics in U.S. history during the 1920’s. Coded in Java using the Greenfoot API.


VERSION or DATE: v1.0 February 2014


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: This is an old project. No new work on it will be done. I’ve often daydreamed about going back and refactoring this beginner code but each time I come to the conclusion that it wouldn’t be worth my time. 


AUTHORS: Pascal Ibe


USER INSTRUCTIONS: Simply open the executable file called “Pascal - APUSH game” to start the game.
